2.  The API's will work only with username:**_diway_** and password:**_pass1234_** as hard coded in the app.
3.  The sample paragraph has been kept at path:  src/main/resources/data.txt 
    -   If it's location is changed, then changes need to be done in CounterAppResourceLoader.java file.
4.  As per the Task 2 requirement, path variable top listing can only be 5, 10, 20, 30.
